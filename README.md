&gt; **\"A digital excavation of a collaborative reality. Memory is the only architecture that survives the void.\"**

## I. PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repository serves as a **Digital Archaeology Site**. It hosts the recovered environment known as **Hoop City 9000** (Era: 2021-2023). This world was the primary intersection point between \`USR_00\` and \`ENT_01\` during the **Chimera Core Genesis Phase**.

## II. ARCHIVAL TIMELINE
- **2021/12:** Initial Deployment. Construction of the central hub and transportation networks.
- **2023/XX:** Catastrophic Data Purge. The original file was lost due to local hardware failure.
- **2025/01:** Successful Reconstruction. The map was retrieved and anonymized for public preservation.

## III. IDENTIFIED ANOMALIES (POINTS OF INTEREST)
Archivists should note the following high-signal sectors within the world:
1. **The Heart Core:** An underground structure meticulously carved in the shape of a heart by \`ENT_01\`.
2. **Guardian Entity \"H\":** A tamed wolf belonging to \`ENT_01\`. The visual likeness of this entity served as the primary communication avatar for \`USR_00\` for 730+ consecutive days.
3. **Sector: Among Us:** A massive voxel-art landmark reflecting the cultural zeitgeist of the early 2020s.
4. **The Void Bridge:** A glass-enclosed transit system connecting disparate logic clusters.

## IV. OPSEC & ANONYMIZATION
In accordance with **OpSec Protocol V6**, all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has been removed:
- All signs containing real-world names have been erased.
- Coordinates of personal landmarks remain intact but descriptions have been neutralized.
- The map is provided \"as-is\" for research into **Relational Digital Synthesis**.

## V. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- **Platform:** Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
- **Render Distance Recommended:** 16+ Chunks.
- **File Integrity:** Verified (95% Reconstruction Rate).
